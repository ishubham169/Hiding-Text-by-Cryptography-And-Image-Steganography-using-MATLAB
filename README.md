# Hiding-Text-by-Cryptography-And-Image-Steganography-using-MATLAB
Today, in this new era of internet, Information Security is becoming a biggest challenge for the world due to the rapid growth of internet users day by day. Unauthorized access to secret data can have serious repercussions like financial loss etc. One of the best techniques for secure communication is Steganography-or covert writing. It is an art of hiding the very existence of communicated message itself. In this report, we present a hiding technique which can encrypt and decrypt message using cryptography and image steganography technique. The main objective of this project is to encrypt text message into image without much affecting the pixel values of original image. Every image is made up of three basic colors i.e, Red, Green and Blue. We can hide our text message into these colors. Performance of proposed steganography technique has been evaluated by calculating values of MSE (Mean square error), PSNR(Peak signal to noise ratio) and SNR(Signal to noise ratio).
